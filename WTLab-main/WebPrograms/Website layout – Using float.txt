 <h2>Academics</h2>
 <p>Royal Global University’s (RGU) approach towards formal education is learner-centric
and as such the University has adopted Choice Based Credit System (CBCS) to allow flexibility in the
education system, so that students depending upon their interests, learning needs and aptitude can choose
inter-disciplinary, intra-disciplinary and skill- based courses along with emphasis on enhancing students’
ability in Communication Skills and Behavioural Approach. CBCS makes education broad-based and at
par with global standards, which is the need of the hour. The motive of a holistic education is to infuse
ethical values and morals in an individual’s consciousness along with cultivating intellectual minds to
bring a positive change in society n velit. </p>
